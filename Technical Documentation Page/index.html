                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
                    is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
                    example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                    its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
                    and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
                    structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
                    variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
                    example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                        to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
                        client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
                        HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                        and page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                        relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
                        extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                        provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
                        the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different
                    in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have
                    Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
                    Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
                    constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
                    JavaScript.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                    declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
                    number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                    JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common
                    class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                    inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
                    JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
                    requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as
                    loosely typed methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
                    have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to
                    be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and
                    you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and
                    function return types are not explicitly typed.

                To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your
                first "Hello world" JavaScript code:<br><br>
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                greetMe("World");
                </code><br><br>

                Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
                browser!

                <p>
                    When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
                    global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
                    current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
                    called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                    function.
                </p>

                <p>
                    JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
                    rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or
                    global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
                    code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global
                    context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
                    is an if statement.
                </p>
                <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                <p>
                    This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
                    ECMAScript 2015.
                </p>

                <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
        defined</code>

            <header>Data types</header>
            <article>
                <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                            <li>
                                null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript
                                is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any
                                other variant.
                            </li>
                            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                            <li>
                                Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
                                unique and immutable.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>and Object</li>
                </ul>
                Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you
                to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
                are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
                objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that
                your application can perform.

        <section class="main-section" id="While_statement">
            <header>While statement</header>
            <article>
                A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition
                evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:<br><br>

                <code>while (condition) statement</code> <br><br>If the condition becomes false,
                statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
                statement following the loop.

                <p>
                    The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
                    the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
                    tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
                    control is passed to the statement following while.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
                    those statements.
                </p>

                Example:

                <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>

                <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
                <p>
                    With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
                    Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                    <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                    <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
                    true, so the loop terminates.
                </p>
